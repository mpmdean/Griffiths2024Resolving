Figure 2 consists of F(q) and G(r) data at varying pump-probe delays.

The pump-probe delays, in increasing order, are contained in the file pump_probe_delay.txt. The first row contains the delay and the second row contains standard error on these values. All delays are provided in picoseconds. Note that there may be an unknown offset to the zero datum. 

The F(q) are contained within the file F.txt. The first row contains the x-axis q in units of inverse Angstroms. Each following line is an F(q) corresponding the the pump-probe delays in order. The F(q) are all scaled arbitrarily (but correctly scaled relative to one another).

The G(r) are contained within the file G.txt. The first row contains the x-axis r in units of  Angstroms. Each following line is a G(r) corresponding the the pump-probe delays in order. The G(r) are scaled arbitrarily (but correctly scaled relative to one another).
