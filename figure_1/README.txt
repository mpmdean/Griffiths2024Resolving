Subfigure 1d contains equilibrium PDFs measured at 150K and 300K. 

The x-axis of this data is contained in file r.txt and is given in units of Angstroms.

The 150K and 300K data is contained in files 150K_G.txt and 300K_G.txt respectively. These PDFs are arbitrarily scaled but are scaled correctly relative to one another.
