The pump-probe delays, in increasing order, are contained in the file pump_probe_delay.txt. The first row contains the delay and the second row contains standard error on these values. All delays are provided in picoseconds. Note that there may be an unknown offset to the zero datum.

The residuals, plotted in subfigure b, are contained in the file residual.txt. Each consecutive pair of lines contains the residuals and the uncertainty on those residuals for the models in this order: Fd-3m, I41/amd, Fddd, F-42m. The residuals are given as percentages.

The lattice parameters, plotted in subfigure c, are contained in the file lattice_parameter.txt. Each consecutive set of size lines contains the a,b and c axes and then the uncertainty on those axes for the models in this order: Fd-3m, I41/amd, Fddd, F-42m. The lattice parameters are given in units of Angstrom.

The Ir ADPs, plotted in subfigure d, are contained in the file Ir_adp.txt. Each consecutive pair of lines contains the ADPs and the uncertainty on those ADPs for the models in this order: Fd-3m, I41/amd, Fddd, F-42m. The ADPs are given in units of square Angstrom.

The Ir ADPs found during the sliding window scan for the I41/amd model, shown in subfigure e, are contained in the file I41_amd_ADP_scan.txt. Each row corresponds to a pump-probe delay. Each column corresponds to a Refinement Length scale. This length scale starts at 12.9 Angstrom and increases in 1 Angstrom steps. The ADPs are given in units of square Angstrom.
